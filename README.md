# crautoscrape

A naive and blunt web scraper for http://crautos.com/, along with some trivial graphs courtesy of pandas and matplotlib - in case you ever want to buy or sell a used car in Costa Rica!

Disclaimer: Whipped together over the weeked mainly by copypasting examples.. whatever. It's incredibly inefficient but solves the task at hand ;)


# Installation

Set up a python venv and get dependencies - these (shell) instructions work on Fedora 28 - adapt as needed:
```
python3 -m venv crauto
cd crauto
. bin/activate
pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib beautifulsoup4 dateparser requests
jupyter notebook
```
